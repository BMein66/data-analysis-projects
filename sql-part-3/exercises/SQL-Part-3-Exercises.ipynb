The full join included ALL VALUES from both datasets, so now each row is a single book marked as to-read by a single person. So each book is typically represented as more than one row, and each person is likely represented as more than one row. The results where user_id and book_id are null are those where no individual user saved that book as to-read. The results where title, avgrating and book_count are null are those bookIDs represented in the to_read table but not in the books table.
